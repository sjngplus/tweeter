# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This app uses jQuery and AJAX for the front-end plus, Node and Express as the back-end. The app helps brush-up on HTML, CSS, and JS skills while learning good coding practices when working with JQuery and single page apps. The app was built with responsive design in mind and works with phones, tablets and desktop.
